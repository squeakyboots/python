Hi! 👋🏽 👋  Welcome to the Exercism Python Repo!

Thank you for opening an issue! 🐍 &nbsp;🌈  ✨

<br>

-   &nbsp;   If you are **requesting support**, we will be along shortly to help. (*generally within* **72 hours,** *often more quickly*).  
-  &nbsp;   **Found a problem** with tests, exercises or something else?? &nbsp;🎉  
&nbsp;&nbsp;We'll take a look as soon as we can & identify what work is needed to fix it. *(generally within* **72 hours**).

​		&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp;If you'd also like to make a PR to **fix** the issue after discussing it,  
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_We &nbsp;💙 &nbsp;PRs that follow our [Exercism](https://exercism.org/docs/building) & [Track](https://github.com/exercism/python/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) contributing guidelines!_

-  &nbsp; Here because of an obvious (*and* **small** *set of*) spelling, grammar, or punctuation issues with **one** exercise,  
&nbsp; concept, or Python document?? 🌟  `Please feel free to submit a PR, linking to this issue.` 🎉

​		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ❗ Please **do not**  run checks on the whole repo & submit a bunch of PRs.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This creates longer review cycles & exhausts reviewers energy & time.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It may also conflict with ongoing changes from other contributors.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For anything complicated or ambiguous, **let's discuss things**  --  we will likely welcome a PR from you.

​		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ❗ Please keep in mind that inserting only blank lines, making a closing bracket drop to the next line, changing a  
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;word to a synonym without obvious reason, adding trailing space that's not a[ EOL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline) for the very end of text files,  
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and other "changes just to change things"  are **not** considered helpful, and will likely be closed by reviewers.
